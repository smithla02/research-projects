### [Improving Lexical Reasoning of Natural Language Models via Data Augmentation and Adversarial Training](https://github.com/smithla02/research-projects/blob/main/Improving%20Lexical%20Reasoning%20of%20Natural%20Language%20Models%20via%20Data%20Augmentation%20and%20Adversarial%20Training.pdf)

#### Objective
Develop strategies to enhance NLI models' ability to understand lexical relationships, especially between antonyms and contradictions.

#### Approach
- Utilized **data augmentation** to enrich training data with antonyms and synonyms, improving lexical reasoning but affecting generalization.
- Employed **adversarial training** with the ANLI dataset, significantly boosting performance on lexical reasoning and generalization.

#### Technologies Used
- Hugging Face (Transformers)

#### Objective
Design an AI agent for ice hockey within the SuperTuxKart ice hockey game using image-based strategies.

#### Approach
- Generated training data from simulated matches to train a **Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)** for puck detection.
- Developed two hand-tuned controller strategies: a simple controller for basic gameplay and an advanced controller utilizing complex tactics based on the puck's estimated 3-D position.

#### Technologies Used
- Pytorch
